# The StudentHouse

The StudentHouse is an organisation for students, by students. At The StudentHouse, these senior students mentor juniors by sharing advice on general student life and their experiences with extra-curriculars. This is a perfect opportunity for students who are trying to join or create their own project. We allow students to work with any existing project in any school in the city or get their own project up and running with the help of our marketing, communications, and illustrations team.
